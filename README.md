# RSIEdit

RSIEdit is a **VERY WIP** GUI for creating/editing [RSI files](https://hackmd.io/@ss14/rsis) and converting existing DMI files to the RSI format. 

It supersedes both the old [RSI Editor](https://github.com/space-wizards/RSI-editor) and [RSI.py](https://github.com/space-wizards/RSI.py). (RSI.py being replaced by RSIEdit's [Importer](https://github.com/space-wizards/RSIEdit/tree/master/Importer)).

## Install

You'll need [.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and an IDE. A binary will be shipped when the Editor is more stable.

For now just run Editor/Program.cs main. (Although it's mainly too unstable to use at this time).
